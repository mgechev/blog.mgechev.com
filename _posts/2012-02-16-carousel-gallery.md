And one post in English&#8230;For few days I&#8217;m developing one jQuery UI plugin. It&#8217;s picture gallery which I&#8217;ve seen in flash but not in JavaScript, that&#8217;s why I decided to fix this. The gallery is a set of rotating pictures and difference ways of handling the perspective. There&#8217;s nothing complicated in it just little analytic geometry. I haven&#8217;t used any canvases or SVG because I&#8217;ve wanted the biggest possible browser compatibility. Of course there&#8217;re are drawbacks from this. There are a lot of computations I don&#8217;t have hardware acceleration and it works slow in the old version of few browsers. Currently I&#8217;m developing webpage for the gallery. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of it: <a href="http://carousel.mgechev.com/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96" title="jQCarousel" src="http://blog.mgechev.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/gallery-logo.png" alt="" width="800" height="279" /></a>  
If you&#8217;re interested in the project you can see it&#8217;s source or fork it at <a title="jQCarousel GitHub" href="https://github.com/mgechev/jqcarousel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
