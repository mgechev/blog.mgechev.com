      <h1>Core Tech Impact Award</h1>
      <section>
        <img src="/images/story/google.png">
        <p>
          Given the success of Angular over the past few years, we won the Core Tech Impact award!
        </p>
        <p>
          Google's Core organization that consists of 4-5k people gives a few impact awards couple of times a year. Small percentage of projects at Core win the Tech Impact award and it meant a lot of me to get this recognition for our team. Compared to other accomplishments on this page, that's a team effort - every person on the Angular team put the work and made this possible!

      <h1>Promotion at Google</h1>
      <section>
        <img src="/images/story/google.png">
        <p>
          I got a second promotion at Google!
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been such a recognition to get to the next level. This happened at the end of October, and just now I feel like I've started to digest it. Being at this level means a lot to me and I hope I am setting a good example for other Googlers in the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recognition came from leading the Angular framework and contributing to the Web strategy at Google, defining our framework narrative. It involved a lot of strategic work, a lot of collaboration, and a lot of learning. The more I grow in my career, the more I understand that the domain expertise is just a part of the job - interpersonal communication, empathy, and care for others is what matter a lot.

        <p>
          Summer of 2023 I did my first trip to Okinawa - the birthplace of karate!
        </p>
        <p>
          This has been my childhood dream since I was 8! Although it was a struggle due to a typhoon, which also interrupted my grading for nidan, I managed to get my second degree black belt under Higaonna Sensei. In the grading commitee there were also Terauchi Sensei, Uehara Sensei, Yonesato Sensei, Joseph Tait Sensei. Grateful to Mirko Sensei for supporting me in the process and Tierney for being next to me...and being my bunkai partner! :)

I also joined the PM team for Wiz, an internal JavaScript framework powering Search, Photos, and more. I'm truly excited about this role. Being in a developer product it'll help me grow my communication, business, and technical skills further.

          When I joined Google I was assigned to work on Angular and exploring how we can build apps at scale with Bazel.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending couple of months and connecting with clients from startups and enterprises we found the sweet spot for Bazel for web developers. The applications of the build tool though span well beyond Web. The Bazel team needed outreach and advocacy support. Working with the Bazel PM we identified top activities for DevRel and establish the team.

        <p>
          On I/O 2021 my team released Angular DevTools. That was a project I had the opportunity to lead from end-to-end starting with analysis of user feedback and requirements, to development, and later rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angular DevTools went through a lot of phases! Early validation, development of the team, cross-collaboration across the organization at Google, integration within the Google I/O 2021 online experience, accessibility and UX audit, etc. I feel so grateful I had the opportunity to work with so many fascinating, talented, and smart people along the way. Angular DevTools hit 20k downloads in 2 days after I/O. After the first month it received over 50k downloads.

        <p>
          One of my highlights from I/O 2021 was the chance to work on a pipeline for predictive prefetching with the TensorFlow team.
        </p>
        <p>
          After identifying the opportunity for predictive prefetching with Guess.js and building a solution in our partnership with TensorFlow we developed a sophisticated pipeline that receives data from Google Analytics, pipes to to TFX via BigQuery, generates a TensorFlow model that we can late use in TensorFlow.js to prefetch resources in any Angular (or not) application. You can read more about our work on the <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/05/speed-up-your-sites-with-web-page-prefetching-using-ml.html">official TensorFlow blog</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For I/O 2021 I also worked on TensorFlow.js <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/ngx-tfjs">bindings</a> for Angular that allow developers to use machine learning in the browser declaratively and efficiently!

        <p>
          That's mostly a sentimental cookie in the jar. My very first karate competition was in kata around 1998-1999. Back then I was 8 years old and my kata was far from great as you can imagine :). That was one of my last kata competitions as well, since I switched to kumite soon afterwards. The reason was mostly that I did not feel prepared and my technique was not great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I had the opportunity to train with some karate legends such as shihan Gosei Yamaguchi and sensei Buchwald in the Bay Area, California. 22 years after my first tournament, there was another karate competition in Veliko Tarnovo so I decided to join! I ended up getting the third place and I was 0.2 points away from the second. I also got a bronze and a silver medals in team kumite and kata, but that was due to my awesome teammates. It was a lot of fun to go back to the place where my karate adventures started :).

          Early 2016, I started a project for static analysis of Angular applications.

          Later, the Angular team introduced codelyzer to the <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a>. In the same time I implemented a few more crucial modules related to templates and styles analysis.

        <p>
          In 2013, I got hired as a contractor to work on the web application for a Silicon Valley startup called Brownie Points. Since then, we built a few more MVPs and a new version of the Brownie Points app. Unfortunately, the business model of Brownie Points cracked because of restrictions set by policies of the Apple's App Store.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/story/rhyme.png">
        <p>
          At that time, I got a few amazing offers from the best technology companies in the Valley. This put me at a crossroad:
          <ul>
            <li>Work with the smartest people in the Valley having a safe job</li>
            <li>...or go into the unknown and work on a startup</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          After we stopped working on Brownie Points, we bootstrapped another idea we had over the years. Because of my high involvement from the beginning and the critical, high-quality modules of the product I developed, in both the front-end and the back-end, I joined as a co-founder and the CTO.

        <p>
          A few weeks before my talk I got a few fun ideas:
          <ul>
            <li>Tool for automatic migrations between Angular versions</li>
            <li>Tool for reverse engineering of Angular applications</li>
            <li>VR visualizer of an Angular application</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          I implemented these ideas and presented them on the conference, together with an overview of how compilers works. The feedback from my talk was great and the tools got widely adopted by the community.

        <p>
          In the product that I was working on - Brownie Points, we decided to go...very bleeding edge. We developed the front end in 25k lines of TypeScript and Angular, while Angular was still in beta.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the product's development, I came up with a scalable architecture which allowed us to perform efficient and coherent state management.

          Unfortunately, such starter project didn't exist back then so I created one and called it Angular Seed.

          A few hours after that, I wrote the first draft of the AngularJS style guide. Later, it got translated to 13 different languages and got over 75 external contributors! Now the project has over 5k stars on GitHub.

        <p>
          That's why in October 2012, I organized the first SofiaJS meetup at initLab, the local hackerspace in Sofia. There were maybe...40 people? That was a huge success for me. I was so happy I can chat about what I do and exchange ideas with others.
