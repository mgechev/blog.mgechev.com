      <h1>Forbes 30 under 30</h1>
      <section>
        <img src="/images/story/forbes.jpg">
        <p>
          On the 4th of January, Forbes Bulgaria published an article called "Beautiful Code" about my story, including me in their selection "30 under 30" for 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          I received this privilledge because of the successful acquisition of Rhyme.com by Coursera and my influential open-source projects and articles.

        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the acquisition, Coursera expanded in Sofia, working with a talented engineering team that I built. This event is a big win for the emerging tech community in Bulgaria. I hope more tech giants discover the potential that this part of the world has!

        <p>
          May 2019 I gave my first talk on Google I/O! The topic of my presentation was "Faster Web Navigation with Predictive Prefetching".
        </p>
        <p>
          In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jB4YWgAxUo">my talk</a> I explained how to use predictive prefetching of JavaScript using Guess.js. Together with my talk, I was also staffing at the "Performance Budgets" booth in the Web Sandbox. I had fantastic several days on the event, brainstorming on different challenging problems with hundreds of engineers from all around the world.

        <p>
          Working for a couple of years on different startups I noticed that I started spending more and more time building tools for developers, speaking on conferences, and writing technical content.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why I decided to pursue my passion and start working full-time on open source frameworks and tooling. I interviewed with Google and joined the Angular team. You can read more about this in the following <a href="https://blog.mgechev.com/2018/11/02/joining-google/">article</a>.

          In March I <a href="https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/976120561070845959">shared</a> my research on topic "Machine Learning-Driven JavaScript Bundling".
        </p>
        <p>
          The article includes an extensive research in the area, a novel approach for achieving data-driven bundling on low level of granularity by using static analysis, and a working prototype with the state of the art Web tooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The techniques include data-driven prefetching and data-driven chunk clustering. A few weeks after I published my article, I had the opportunity to present the research in Oxford, UK during Render 2018.

          A day before my birthday, on the 1st of November 2017, the third edition of my book "Switching to Angular" got published!
        </p>
        <p>
          It incorporated the latest changes introduced by Angular version 5 and incorporated additional improvements such as introduction to structural typing, alignment to the new <code>StaticInjector</code> API and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very thankful to the Angular team for their assistance during the alignment to the latest changes introduced to the framework. They are a constant inspiration!

        <p>
          On 10th of October 2017, I became the first laureate, in the history of the national award "John Atanasoff" of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, who has been awarded in two different categories in one year.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Rumen Radev awarded me with a diploma for the award "John Atanasoff", which is given to young scientists and professionals with contributions with global impact to the development of computer science and software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second award, that the President awarded me with, is for the development of a project with wide social impact.

      <section>
        <img src="/images/story/codelyzer.png">
        <p>
          Early 2016, I started a project for static analysis of Angular applications. Some of my core motivations were an automatic verification of the assignments of my students in the class "Advanced JavaScript" at Sofia University, and automatic, static enforcement of the practices from the Angular style guide I worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, the Angular team introduced codelyzer to the <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a>. In the same time I implemented a few more crucial modules related to templates and styles analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Late September 2016, codelyzer hit 1,000,000 monthly downloads!

      <h1>Co-founder & CTO at Rhyme</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          In 2013, I got hired as a contractor to work on the web application for a Silicon Valley startup called Brownie Points. Since then, we built a few more MVPs and a new version of the Brownie Points app. Unfortunately, the business model of Brownie Points cracked because of restrictions set by policies of the Apple's App Store.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/story/rhyme.png">
        <p>
          At that time, I got a few amazing offers from the best technology companies in the Valley. This put me at a crossroad:
          <ul>
            <li>Work with the smartest people in the Valley having a safe job</li>
            <li>...or go into the unknown and work on a startup</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          After we stopped working on Brownie Points, we bootstrapped another idea we had over the years. Because of my high involvement from the beginning and the critical, high-quality modules of the product I developed, in both the front-end and the back-end, I joined as a co-founder and the CTO.

          In the beginning of 2017, I applied for a talk on ng-conf, called "Mad Science with the Angular Compiler". At the time I wrote the proposal I didn't have a clear idea of what my presentation is going to be about. I had some blurry thoughts about compilers, visual UI builders for VSCode, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks before my talk I got a few fun ideas:
          <ul>
            <li>Tool for automatic migrations between Angular versions</li>
            <li>Tool for reverse engineering of Angular applications</li>
            <li>VR visualizer of an Angular application</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          I implemented these ideas and presented them on the conference, together with an overview of how compilers works. The feedback from my talk was great and the tools got widely adopted by the community.

        </p>
        <p>
          It was a great experience to explain in deep details the tools I was working with on a daily basis. I found it fascinating to connect concepts from the theoretical computer science to the wild JavaScript ecosystem.

      <h1>Founded SofiaJS</h1>

        <img src="/images/story/sofiajs.png">
        <p>
          In Sofia that time, there were user groups for Java and .NET but when I was looking for a JavaScript community I wasn't able to find one. I wanted to meet like-minded people who I can chat with.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why in October 2012, I organized the first SofiaJS meetup at initLab, the local hackerspace in Sofia. There were maybe...40 people? That was a huge success for me. I was so happy I can chat about what I do and exchange ideas with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until then, I organized tens of events either by myself or with the help of the other co-organizers, especially Mihail Mateev (the most prominent MVP in Bulgaria) and Georgi Serev!

        <p>
          In high school, I was taking apart in National competitions in software development. According to the rules, students had to develop a complete software project on whatever topic we want and present it in front of a jury from Sofia University.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one of these competitions, I developed a CMS system from scratch (yes, not even jQuery) with intensive Ajax usage (yes, Ajax was a big deal back then...we used workaround the lack of wide support for XMLHttpRequest with hidden iframes). I was a laureate in a few competitions and my CMS system was used for the official website of my high school.

          In 2008, just before I got my black belt in karate, I became the National champion of Bulgaria in Kumite (sparing).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no better feeling than hearing "We Are The Champions" by Queen while getting my gold medal. This championship gave me the opportunity to train with the National Karate team as preparation for the European championship.

        <p>
          In 2007 I got introduced to Web development by my high school teacher Svilen Dimitrov. He provided an incredible support helping me to understand the basics of JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, and Flash.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks after that, I developed my first website for the TV show "Perfect Strangers". Later, I developed a few more web applications for collecting data from observations of meteor showers.
        </p>
        <p>
          About the same time I developed a few more games with Visual Basic and C++.

          Well, although I developed my first "Space Invaders" game a bit earlier using different tools (drawing the graphics myself on MS Paint), I wrote my first real program in Pascal.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was one of these simple "Hello World!" programs. I was amazed that I was able to write instructions to control a machine.

          I was fascinated by the space. I had my old Russian telescope reflector from the brand "Alkor". I used to spend almost every clear night observing the sky, writing down my observations in a notebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's how I got introduced to our local Astronomy school in Troyan where I met one of the most dedicated teachers - Nadka Dankova. She was helping me with the preparation for the National astronomy competitions I was participating in.
