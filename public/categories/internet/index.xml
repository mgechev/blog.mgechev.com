      <title>AngularJS style guide</title>

      <description>Today I created a GitHub repository which contains a set of good practices and style guides for AngularJS application development.
Its main goal is to be community-driven and to concentrate all the best practices for AngularJS development in one place.
I&amp;#8217;ve collected these guidelines mostly from my own experience and the source code of AngularJS. I guess there are missing things thats why I&amp;#8217;ll try to fill the gaps in future.</description>

      <description>This blog post is concentrated about web performance. I&amp;#8217;ll skip the well known stuff about combining images into sprites, inlining images, DNS pre-fetching, combining and minifying script files, gzipping and so on. There are plenty of articles and tools which will help you about these things. There are also excellent researches on these topics, few of the best I&amp;#8217;ve read are these by Mobify, Web Performance Daybook Volume, High Performance Web Sites and Critical rendering path &amp;#8211; Crash course on web performance and many others.</description>

      <title>Aspect-Oriented Programming with AngularJS</title>

      <description>In the following blog post I&amp;#8217;ll write few words about what is Aspect-Oriented Programming, why I think it will be useful in AngularJS and I&amp;#8217;m also going to give you a short tutorial for using a simple AOP framework I&amp;#8217;ve developed.
First things first. What is AOP? As we all know OOP is awesome! It gives us many tools for making our development process simpler. Its core principles are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.</description>

      <title>CSS3 flipping effect</title>

      <description>As you know because of the SIMD nature of the GPU it&amp;#8217;s extremely good for graphical calculations. Since HTML5 and CSS3 are here we have a couple of ways for efficient and smooth animations one of them are the CSS3 transitions.
Before few days I needed a CSS3 flipping effect which should works at least in IE10, Chrome 25+ and Firefox. I tried different demos which I found in the web but there were couple of issues with them.</description>

      <description>Before few months I was invited by Telerik Academy to make a talk about JavaScript. Last Monday Marian Kostadinov, Radoslav Georgiev and me made a whole seminar about the topic. I&amp;#8217;m addicted to the Object-Oriented programming so I choose to talk about that. You can find my slides at http://blog.mgechev.com/slides/javascript-patterns and a video (in Bulgarian) below in the post:
It was quite exciting for me to speak about this topic in front of about 200 people.</description>

      <title>JavaScript, the weird parts</title>

      <description>To say that JavaScript is becoming more and more popular is such a typical and boring way to start such an awesome post&amp;#8230;Anyway, JavaScript is becoming more and more popular each day&amp;#8230;There&amp;#8217;s client-side JavaScript with awesome API, you can do whatever you wish with it &amp;#8211; write 3D games, stream video and audio, process files&amp;#8230;There&amp;#8217;s also a server-side JavaScript which is also awesome (I guess awesome will be a common word for this post).</description>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/01/11/virtualization-into-the-browser/</guid>
      <description>plainvm can take the virtualization into different level of usage. To prove this I&amp;#8217;ll first ask few rhetorical questions and put their answers&amp;#8230;Which is the programming language which everyone has interpreter for? Java? Actually no! Does iOS supports Java applets for example?! No! Everyone has a browser in his smartphone. Every browser (well may be I should exclude lynx, links&amp;#8230;) has JavaScript interpreter. And what is the common thing between all modern devices (and actually the devices most wide spread) &amp;#8211; the browser.</description>

      <title>HTML5 image editor</title>

      <description>As you see HTML5 is everywhere (of course I exclude IE&amp;#8230;or just before version 10). Web site used for quick image composition or edition is something very useful for the &amp;#8220;modern web person&amp;#8221;. There are few such services. Most of them use Flash. Nothing against it but&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s too heavy for me&amp;#8230;unnecessarily heavy. For all that stuff you can use HTML5 canvas. I also found some HTML5 image editors but their functionality was very limited.</description>

      <description>And one post in English&amp;#8230;For few days I&amp;#8217;m developing one jQuery UI plugin. It&amp;#8217;s picture gallery which I&amp;#8217;ve seen in flash but not in JavaScript, that&amp;#8217;s why I decided to fix this. The gallery is a set of rotating pictures and difference ways of handling the perspective. There&amp;#8217;s nothing complicated in it just little analytic geometry. I haven&amp;#8217;t used any canvases or SVG because I&amp;#8217;ve wanted the biggest possible browser compatibility.</description>

      <title>Color animation plugin for jQuery</title>

      <description>Hi! I haven&amp;#8217;t wrote since a long time but there&amp;#8217;s so much code and so little time&amp;#8230;It&amp;#8217;s bad that the biggest part of the code is not open source but what can we do&amp;#8230;Last few hours I developed a JavaScript plugin for color animation. Of course for few hours I cant make something with great quality so it&amp;#8217;s a little bit unstable (I think) but it works and it&amp;#8217;s also valid for the JSLint standards.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/2011/11/01/cross-browser-sound-notifications/</guid>
      <description>Few days ago I was creating a system in which it was necessary to implement a sound notification feature. Well it&amp;#8217;s not very hard task but of course you have to be careful with the browser compatibility. At first my source was something like that:
playSound: function () { this.config.soundNotify.html(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;embed src=&amp;quot;&amp;#39; + this.config.soundFile + &amp;#39;.wav&amp;quot; hidden=true autostart=true loop=false&amp;gt;&amp;#39;); }  Actually in my Linux it was working pretty well (I tried it mainly in Chrome).</description>

      <description>Тази сутрин пуснах прословутата f8&amp;#8230;Бях с големи очаквания (дори поствах за нея), може би заради слабата ми информираност очаквах нещо като Google I/O (има си Google&amp;#8230;защо не потърсих предварително&amp;#8230;). Streaming-a тръгна и очаквано видях Марк Зукърбърг. Вместо той да говори за нови технологии и с какви средства е създал нещо ново, започна да прави реклама на новите feature-и на Facebook&amp;#8230;Дам трябваше да прочета повече преди да си настроя часовника да звъни толкова рано&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Като всеки любознателен developer и аз се включих към хората, които искат да получат mail от Google при пускането на API за Google+. Вчера (15-ти септември) около 1 часа получих следния mail:
 Getting Started on the Google+ API
Greetings developers,
Thank you for showing your interest in the Google+ platform on our developer interest form. We promised to let you know when we had more details to share. Well, that time has come&amp;#8230;</description>

      <title>Ajax without jQuery for beginners</title>
      <link>http://blog.mgechev.com/2011/07/21/ajax-jquery-beginners/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/2011/07/21/ajax-jquery-beginners/</guid>
      <description>Before years I was writing all the code by my own, without additional libraries (including jQuery). For beginner developer it&amp;#8217;s a good strategy. When you use $.ajax it&amp;#8217;s all that easy:
$.ajax({ url: &amp;quot;any/url/for/the/request&amp;quot;, type: &amp;quot;get&amp;quot;, success: function(data){ alert(data); } });  But you can&amp;#8217;t get the main idea.
Many developers don&amp;#8217;t have an idea how to write this without a library. In their opinion AJAX without library a hard, near impossible task.</description>
