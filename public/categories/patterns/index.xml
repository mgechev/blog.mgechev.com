      <description>This publication aims to provide a more theoretical overview of some of the AngularJS components in order to show you how the things you are already familiar with (like different Object-Oriented Design Patterns) fit in the picture.

      <description>In this series of blog posts I’m going to cover the paper I’m writing at GitHub.
It aims to provide a bit more theoretical overview of some of the AngularJS components in order to show you how the things you are already familiar with (like different Object-Oriented Design Patterns) fit in the picture.
Part one includes only a high level overview of AngularJS, enjoy it.
AngularJS overview AngularJS is JavaScript framework developed by Google.</description>

      <title>Singleton in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Wikipedia describes the singleton design pattern as:
 The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.</description>

      <title>The magic of $resource (or simply a client-side Active Record)</title>

      <description>At first sight AngularJS seems like a magical framework, which does some weird but awesome things like dependency injection, data binding only by setting a single property to the magical object named $scope and many other things.
If you look at the source code of Angular you’ll see a lot of smart and simple solutions for these magical problems. In this blog post I’ll describe the magic which stays behind $resource.</description>

      <title>AngularJS Inheritance Patterns</title>

      <description>Since AngularJS does not provide any built-in features for using inheritance, in this blog post I’ll describe how the general JavaScript inheritance patterns can be applied to AngularJS components.
Controllers inheritance First, lets talk about controllers. Actually it is very unlikely to inherit from parent controller (except when you&amp;rsquo;re using the controller as syntax, see below). This is the case because by implementation the scope in the child controller will inherit prototypically from its parent scope.</description>

      <description>Today I created a GitHub repository which contains a set of good practices and style guides for AngularJS application development.
Its main goal is to be community-driven and to concentrate all the best practices for AngularJS development in one place.
I’ve collected these guidelines mostly from my own experience and the source code of AngularJS. I guess there are missing things thats why I’ll try to fill the gaps in future.</description>

      <title>Aspect-Oriented Programming with AngularJS</title>

      <description>In the following blog post I’ll write few words about what is Aspect-Oriented Programming, why I think it will be useful in AngularJS and I’m also going to give you a short tutorial for using a simple AOP framework I’ve developed.
First things first. What is AOP? As we all know OOP is awesome! It gives us many tools for making our development process simpler. Its core principles are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.</description>

      <title>Why I should use publish/subscribe in JavaScript</title>
      <link>http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/04/24/why-to-use-publishsubscribe-in-javascript/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/04/24/why-to-use-publishsubscribe-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>This post is inspired by my answer at StackOverflow.
So why we should use publish/subscribe? Why it is useful? Is it making our work harder or it makes our application better?
And the answer&amp;hellip;
It’s all about loose coupling and single responsibility, which goes hand to hand with MV* (MVC/MVP/MVVM) patterns in JavaScript which are very modern in the last few years.
Loose coupling is an Object-oriented principle in which each component of the system knows it’s responsibility and don’t care about the other components (or at least tries to not care about them as much as possible).</description>

      <title>Functional programming with JavaScript</title>
      <link>http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/01/21/functional-programming-with-javascript/</link>

      <description>This article is about the functional concepts of JavaScript. Some of them are built-in the languages, others extra implemented but all of them are very common for purely functional languages like Haskell. First I want to tell what I mean with the term purely functional language. These languages are “safe”, they will not make side effect i.e. evaluating an expression won’t change something in the internal state and lead to different result of the same expression when called next time.</description>

      <title>Self-invoking functions in JavaScript (or Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)</title>

      <description>JavaScript is a bit of a strange language, sometimes doing strange things if you don’t follow best practices and if you’re not familiar with the ECMA standard. There are numerous strange things in the JavaScript syntax, one of those being the self-executing (self-invoking) functions. Here’s the syntax:
(function () { //body of the function }());  The main idea is that the anonymous function above is being invoked right after it has been defined.</description>
