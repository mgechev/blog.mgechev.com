      <description>In this blog post I&amp;#8217;m going to show you how to build a VNC client using AngularJS and Yeoman. The source code used in the post is available at my GitHub. Click here to see the final result.

It seems I have affinity to the remote desktop protocols, because this is my third project at GitHub, which implements one (VNC client on 200 lines of JavaScript, VNC client for Chrome DevTools and VNC client with AngularJS).</description>

      <description>In this blog post I&amp;#8217;ll tell few words about the course Advanced JavaScript which Georgi Penkov, Evgeni Kunev and me are leading this semester in Sofia University.
I was included as a lecturer in it after my project for Practical Programming with Perl (plainvm) which is created by Georgi Penkov. The idea behind the course is not to concentrate on the syntax of JavaScript but to introduce to the students different modern technologies.</description>

      <description>In this quick blog post I&amp;#8217;ll show you how to create a simple VNC client in about 200 lines of JavaScript. For our goal we&amp;#8217;re going to use only HTML5 and JavaScript (client and server side). The end result will be something like this:

So, let&amp;#8217;s begin!
Our application will have very simple architecture &amp;#8211; a proxy server written in Node.js and a client in HTML5 and JavaScript. The Node.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m here again, after a long pause. For a while I&amp;#8217;ve got problems with my health and I&amp;#8217;m nailed at home&amp;#8230;so I&amp;#8217;ve go a lot of free time. Last night I&amp;#8217;ve decided to root my Google Nexus S.
I use Ubuntu

12.04 on my home machine so I put on it Oracle Java and Android SDK. I also installed few packages from the SDK (platform-tools). I created few udev rules, because my computer wasn&amp;#8217;t able to know what to do when I plug-in my Nexus with a fastboot mode.</description>
