      <description>And one more blog post by me! It’s going to be in brand new topic than the others. For about an year and a half I’ve got an idea which I wanted to accomplish&amp;hellip;To create my own simple programming language. Actually it’s very useful task and quite interesting. Creating it you can get better understanding how the compilers and interpreters work and probably write better code. Unfortunately there were two problems&amp;hellip;I didn’t have enough time for such task and&amp;hellip;I’ve not studied formal grammars (and as I mentioned I don’t have enough time to study them&amp;hellip;there are just so much more interesting things to read about :-P ).</description>
