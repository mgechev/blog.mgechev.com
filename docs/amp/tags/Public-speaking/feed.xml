      <description>Over the past 7 years, I gave over 125+ talks for 20 countries in front of over 50,000+ people. By any means, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me an expert in public speaking, but I had the opportunity to learn a few things that I&amp;rsquo;d love to share.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll spread the content between a couple of different posts covering everything from planning, preparing the talk, rehearsals, and presentation at the event. I&amp;rsquo;d not discuss research, but this phase will naturally produce artifacts for the planning process.</description>
