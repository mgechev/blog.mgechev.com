      <description>While experimenting with enhancements of the prediction model of Guess.js, I started looking at deep learning. I&amp;rsquo;ve focused mainly on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM because of their &amp;ldquo;unreasonable effectiveness&amp;rdquo; in the domain of Guess.js. In the same time, I started playing with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which although less traditionally, are also often used for time series. CNNs are usually used for image classification, recognition, and detection.</description>
