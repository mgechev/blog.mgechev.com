      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the early implementation of a few tools which based on techniques from the machine learning allow us to perform data-driven chunk clustering and pre-fetching for single-page applications. The purpose is to provide a zero-configuration mechanism which based on data from Google Analytics for the users&amp;rsquo; behavior performs the most optimal build. We&amp;rsquo;re also going to introduce a webpack plugin which works with Angular CLI and Create React App.</description>

      <description>Decorators in JavaScript are now in stage 2. They allow us to alter the definition of a class, method, or a property. There are already a few neat libraries which provide decorators and make our life easier by allowing us to write more declarative code with better performance characteristics.
In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll share a few decorators which I&amp;rsquo;m using on a daily basis. We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at:</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you a few tricks which can make your life using Immutable.js and Redux with TypeScript easier. All the practices are inspired by my recent work on the project Rhyme.com.
Immutable Statically Typed Records Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the definition of our store. For the purpose I prefer to use Immutable records because of two main reasons:
 Immutable stores make the mutation more explicit and well organized.</description>

      <description>For the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project which uses React with TypeScript and Redux. In a few blog posts I&amp;rsquo;m planning to share lessons learned while combining these technologies. In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll share a few anti-patterns related to state management that I noticed in our development process. In the second article I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on testability.
All of the anti-patterns below have the following structure:
 Introduction Problem definition Sample solutions with discussion of their pros and cons  State Duplication Sometimes we have instances of the same business entity used in different contexts.</description>

      <description>In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at another Angular abstraction - the differs and more specifically the IterableDiffer; we&amp;rsquo;ll explain what the differs are and how the framework uses them internally. After that, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how NgForOf works and design a custom data structure optimized for the directive. Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll develop a custom differ which will speed up the change detection mechanism of Angular when working with large collections.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on techniques from functional programming we can apply in order to improve the performance of our applications, more specifically pure pipes, memoization, and referential transparency. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part of the &amp;ldquo;Faster Angular Applications&amp;rdquo; series, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you to take a look at it or at least get familiar with the structure of the business application that we&amp;rsquo;re optimizing.

      <description>On AngularConnect 2017 in London I gave a talk called &amp;ldquo;Purely Fast&amp;rdquo;. In the presentation I shown how step by step we can improve the performance of a business application. In the example I incorporated as many performance issues as possible which I faced over the past a couple of years developing enterprise Angular and AngularJS applications. After the presentation I got great feedback for the content so I decided to write a series of blog posts which aim to explain the content from &amp;ldquo;Purely Fast&amp;rdquo; in details.</description>

      <description>This post will be dedicated to template references in Angular and dynamic scoping. Although the main focus of the article will be understanding TemplateRef we will also touch semantics of programming languages by introducing the concept of scope of name binding.
The code samples for this article can be found in my GitHub account.

      <description>I already wrote a couple of essays related to the development of programming languages that I was extremely excited about! For instance, in &amp;ldquo;Static Code Analysis of Angular 2 and TypeScript Projects&amp;ldquo;[1] I explored the basics of the front end of the compilers, explaining the phases of lexical analysis, syntax analysis and abstract-syntax trees.
Recently I published &amp;ldquo;Developing Statically Typed Programming Language&amp;ldquo;[2]. This post shown a simple, statically typed, functional programming language inspired by lambda calculus.</description>

      <description>In this blog post we&amp;rsquo;ll go through a sample implementation of a type checker, interpreter and a transpiler for a basic purely functional programming language, which is based on the lambda calculus. We will do a &amp;ldquo;full-stack&amp;rdquo; programming language development by going through formal definition of the language&amp;rsquo;s syntax, semantics and type system. After that we&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how we can &amp;ldquo;translate&amp;rdquo; these definitions to JavaScript.
Although the article doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any mathematical background, it&amp;rsquo;ll be useful to have high-level understanding of how compilers work.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this blog post I discuss the idea of using virtual reality for gamification of manual tasks in the software development process. I introduce a demo project which allows source code visualization and manipulation in a generated Minecraft-like virtual reality. My initial presentation of the demo project was on ngconf 2017, and the project&amp;rsquo;s extension I presented on AngularUP 2017 during my talks &amp;ldquo;Mad Science with the Angular Compiler&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In this article we&amp;rsquo;re going to quickly explore 7 Angular development tools which can make our everyday life easier. The purpose of the list is to not be opinionated architecture wise. This means that we&amp;rsquo;re not going to discuss tooling which has impact over our choice of application state management, data layer, etc. For instance, although packages like ngrx/store devtools, universal, and others are amazing once we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen a specific architectural approach, we&amp;rsquo;re going to keep them out of this article because they assume we&amp;rsquo;re using a specific way of state management or application rendering.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been hired to work on a huge legacy Angular project with thousands of NgModules, components, directives, pipes and services? Neither do I. Angular (2 and above) is still relatively new framework and there are not many enormous projects out there. On the other hand, Angular is powerful and in combination with TypeScript we can build big, enterprise applications.
Exploring an Application It&amp;rsquo;s hard to start digging into a large codebase without being aware of the overall structure of the project.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging mostly about Angular and it&amp;rsquo;s not by accident! Angular is an amazing framework, bringing a lot of innovation to the front-end technologies, with a great community behind it. In the same time, the projects that I&amp;rsquo;m working on have various of different requirements and sometimes I need to consider different options.
Another great technology that I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past is React. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to compare it with Angular; I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are variety of cases when one of them fits better compared to the other and visa versa.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly explain the minimum you need to know in order to publish an Angular component to npm. By the end of the post you&amp;rsquo;ll know how your module can:
 Be platform independent (i.e. run in Web Workers, Universal). Should be bundled and distributed. Work with the Angular&amp;rsquo;s Ahead-of-Time compiler. Play well with TypeScript by allowing autocompletion and compile-time type checking.  If you&amp;rsquo;re only interested in a quick checklist of things you need to consider for distributing your Angular library, go directly to the &amp;ldquo;Distributing an Angular Library - Checklist&amp;rdquo; section.</description>

      <description>In this informal essay I&amp;rsquo;ll go through a case study of my experience in using Angular (2 and above) in production.
Last April, together with a small team, we started working on an educational application; the second version of a product that I developed about 3 years ago using Angular 1.
The product targets young kids and their parents. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to motivate kids to learn maths by earning rewards.</description>

      <description>Recently I added Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation support to angular-seed and got a lot of questions about the new feature. In order to answer most of them, we will start from the beginning by explaining the following topics:
 Why we need compilation in Angular? What needs to be compiled? How it gets compiled? When the compilation takes place? Just-in-Time (JiT) vs Ahead-of-Time (AoT). What we get from AoT? How the AoT compilation works?</description>

We did this by using the following techniques:
 Angular offline template compiler for generating tree-shakable code. Tree-shaking of ES2015 modules with rollup. Bundling of the application. Minification with uglifyjs. Compression with gzip.  Although we achieved impressive results we can do even better!</description>

      <description>Stripe offer a set of APIs which allow businesses and individuals to easily accept and manage payments online. In a typical scenario you want your users to pay for a service that you&amp;rsquo;re offering using Stripe as a mediator.
On the other hand, Angular is gathering more and more popularity. A lot of developers are including the framework as part of their production applications.
In this blog post we will briefly describe what problems you may face using the Stripe APIs with Angular and how you can solve them.</description>

      <description>Progressive Web Applications help us build native-like web apps, thanks to amazing tools such as Service Workers, IndexDB, App Shell etc. Once the browser downloads all the static assets required by our app, the active Service Worker can cache them locally.
This way the user may experience slowdown during the initial page load, but each next time she opens the application her experience will be instant!
In order to help developers take advantage of the technologies behind the PWA as easy as possible, the Angular team is working on the Angular mobile-toolkit.</description>

      <description>For the last a couple of months I&amp;rsquo;m working on an Angular 2 based PWA. The more complex the application gets, the more I appreciate that our choice was Angular! For routing we&amp;rsquo;re using the initial Angular 2 router that is now deprecated. For sure we will migrate to the newest one once it gets stable but until then we have some problems to solve.
One of the features that I miss most in both the new and the newest Angular 2 routes is the resolve functionality which the AngularJS 1.</description>

A couple of months ago I started working on the first version of a Silicon Valley-based startup. The project is a single-page application with quite dynamic business requirements. As in most modern single-page applications we have a fat client which encapsulates decent amount of business logic and state.</description>

      <description>Maintaining the angular-seed, I found out that the most common problem for developers using the project is:
 Duplicate identifier &amp;#39;export=&amp;#39;. (2300)  compilation error.
In this quick tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll show what does this error mean and how you can fix it. In order to get better understanding of the problem we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript, as well as ambient type definitions and @types.
Intro Before getting any further we need to tell a few words about the ambient type definitions of TypeScript.</description>

The current post is about an exciting project I am working on in my spare time.</description>

      <description>About two weeks ago I published the initial draft of a Community-driven Angular 2 Style Guide. It was based on:
 Patterns I noticed in the Angular 2 source code while contributing to the framework. Suggestions by Miško Hevery during his technical review of my book &amp;ldquo;Switching to Angular 2&amp;rdquo;. My own development experience with Angular 2. AngularJS 1.x common practices which could be applied to Angular 2 applications keeping the transition process smoother.</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain the difference between the concepts of view children and content children in Angular. We will take a look at how we can pass access these two different kinds of children from their parent component. Along the content we are also going to mention what the difference between the properties providers and viewProviders of the @Component decorator is.

      <description>Warning: This version of the Angular 2 router is now deprecated! This means that soon the used below APIs will no longer be available.  A couple of months ago I wrote &amp;ldquo;Lazy Loading of Route Components in Angular 2&amp;rdquo;, where I explained how we can take advantage of the AsyncRoutes and the virtual proxy pattern in Angular 2.
This way we can incrementally load the entire application by only requesting the resources required for the individual views.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I watched a few talks from ReactEurope. I was truly impressed by a few of them and especially by the one by Dan Abramov on redux and his hot loader. The tool he shown helps you do something similar to live-reload with one big difference. When you change the code of any of the components in your react application, the new version of the component is send to the application itself where all its instances are patched so the changes you did to be visible.</description>

      <description>Note: The following blog post is based on the library aspect.js, which can be found here.
The object-oriented programming paradigm is powerful. We design an OO system by decomposition of the problem domain, following guiding principles concerning the decomposition and the communication between the different modules. The process is structured; it involves logical thinking, understanding of the domain and eventual predictions for the future evolution of the system. Often we&amp;rsquo;re trying to keep our code DRY (not always), highly coherent and loosely coupled.</description>

      <description>This is the second, and probably be the last, blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. In the first post we did a quick overview of flux, took a look at the stateless, pure components, immutable data structures and component communication. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to introduce the store and how we can communicate with services through the network via HTTP, WebSocket or WebRTC. Since the flux architecture doesn&amp;rsquo;t define a way of communication with external services, here you can find my way of dealing with network communication.</description>

      <description>JavaScript is a weird language although, we love it the way it is. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a painful experience working on big JavaScript projects. It was painful in the same way it gets painful working on huge Ruby, Python, PHP projects.
Once you have code base above 10-15k lines of code and you decide to do some refactoring&amp;hellip;well it gets messy. Although grep and sed are powerful tools for text manipulation, when you start replacing code with them, you&amp;rsquo;re missing the semantics (or the context) of the snippets you substitute.</description>

      <description>This is the first blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. Is this &amp;ldquo;yet the another flux tutorial&amp;rdquo;? What I have seen so far, while researching flux, were mostly &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; tutorials (usually with todo applications), which describe the main components of given flux application and the data flow between them. This is definitely useful for getting a high-level overview of how everything works but in reality there are plenty of other things, which should be taken under consideration.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I posted the article &amp;ldquo;Boost the Performance of an AngularJS Application Using Immutable Data&amp;rdquo;. It shows how to speedup your AngularJS application when having a lot of bindings to big data collections. The idea behind the optimization is quite simple - create a new collection when the data changes. This way you can reduce the watchers execution from O(n) to O(1).
In the post I did simple profiling using the built-in Date but it didn&amp;rsquo;t give enough information in exactly which cases it is more suitable to use immutable data and when you should bet on the standard collections.</description>

      <description>On 18th of September 2014 was pushed the initial commit of version 2.0 of the AngularJS framework. A few weeks ago the core team at Google, published AngularJS&amp;rsquo; 2.0 website and gave a couple of talks on ng-conf about their new router, change detection, templating, etc. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about AngularJS since its early versions so I decided give it a try using the quick start. In the meantime I and also created an angular2-seed project for my test, dummy projects.</description>

      <description>My practice proved that there are two good/easy ways to learn a new technology:
 Re-implement it by your own See how the concepts you already know fit in it  In some cases the first approach is too big overhead. For instance, if you want to understand how the kernel works it is far too complex and slow to re-implement it. It might work to implement a light version of it (a model), which abstracts components that are not interesting for your learning purposes.</description>

      <description>ReactJS is a framework, by facebook, which adds some well known concepts into the UI development. Each UI could be represented as a state machine but when the state of this state machine could be changed from a lot of places everything gets quite messy, complex and buggy. Given view may be rendered differently with the same model passed as parameter if it depends on some global data. A properly implemented ReactJS component, will be rendered the same way when the same &amp;ldquo;input parameters&amp;rdquo; are passed to it.</description>

      <description>I have affinity to functional programming since my first year in college. During my initial contact with a purely functional programming language (Haskell in my case) I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand all the advantages it provides, everything was reduced to just writing a cool recursive functions and solving algorithmic problems.
Later, when my code was used in production, I started appreciating things like high-order functions, closures, currying, etc. I even wrote a blog post on topic &amp;ldquo;Functional programming with JavaScript&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;m trying to build high-performance consumption of binary protocol through the browser. The protocol is running over TCP. In the perfect world I&amp;rsquo;d be talking with the remote TCP server, through TCP sockets, connecting directly from the client-side JavaScript and consuming the received binary data.
Because of limitations of the client-side API, JavaScript doesn&amp;rsquo;t has access to plain TCP sockets, there&amp;rsquo;s no full happiness. The second best option would be to use intermediate proxy, which:</description>

      <description>ES6 specification is being clarified every passed day! One of the key features of the new version of the language are the generators. Generators (a.k.a. semicoroutines) will play quite important role after they are being officially released. They could be used to simplify the asynchronous control flow of any JavaScript program (look at co). Another important role is using them for creating iterators.
In this blog post we are going to take a look at how could be implemented iterator of binary search tree using the ES6 generators.</description>

The application from this tutorial is available at GitHub.
React.js React.js is reactive JavaScript framework, which helps you to build user interface. Facebook states that we can think of React as the &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; in MVC. React&amp;rsquo;s main aspect is the state. When the state of the application changes this automatically propagates through the application&amp;rsquo;s components.</description>

 Faster! - static HTML is much faster than my old WordPress blog. Lighter - Jekyll is much more minimalistic than WordPress, it has all I need and in the same time it is not too much. I can use VIM! - I can use my favorite text editor in order to:  configure my blog write blog posts  Reliable hosting - last a couple of yeas I pay for hosting, which is not reliable enough.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia describes the singleton design pattern as:
 The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you want to test your application in environment closer to the real world. In such cases you might need to run it over TLS.
Here are two simple steps, which can be used to achieve this result:
Generate self-signed certificate If you don’t already have certificate you need to generate one:
 $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365  You will be asked a couple of questions&amp;hellip; In this case we generated a self-signed certificate for 365 days.</description>

      <description>Why should I use JavaScript MVC, MVVM, MVP or simply MVW(hatever works for you)?
When I talk with people, who are beginners/intermediate in JavaScript I’m often asked this question. They are usually people who, until now, have used JavaScript only for making their website “fancier” – adding client-side form validation, creating carousel, checking whether a user already exists with simple Ajax request. When you start building something bigger (+10k lines of JavaScript) I truly believe that there are a few benefits from using such micro-architectural frameworks.</description>

      <description>At first sight AngularJS seems like a magical framework, which does some weird but awesome things like dependency injection, data binding only by setting a single property to the magical object named $scope and many other things.
If you look at the source code of Angular you’ll see a lot of smart and simple solutions for these magical problems. In this blog post I’ll describe the magic which stays behind $resource.</description>

      <description>Since AngularJS does not provide any built-in features for using inheritance, in this blog post I’ll describe how the general JavaScript inheritance patterns can be applied to AngularJS components.
Controllers inheritance First, lets talk about controllers. Actually it is very unlikely to inherit from parent controller (except when you&amp;rsquo;re using the controller as syntax, see below). This is the case because by implementation the scope in the child controller will inherit prototypically from its parent scope.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I’ll introduce you the new way of annotating services included in AngularAOP v0.1.0.
First, why we need a new way for annotation? In v0.0.1 the annotations were made in services’ bodies. It was something like this:
myApp.factory(&amp;#39;AwesomeService&amp;#39;, function (execute, d1, d2,...,dn) { var api = /* definition of our service api */ return execute(Logger).onThrowOf(execute(Authorization).before(api, { methodPattern: /Special|getArticleById/, argsPatterns: [/^user$/, /^[Ii]d(_num)?$/] })); });  This way of annotating services led to coupling between the services and the API of the AngularAOP’s aspect factory service called execute.</description>

      <description>Today I created a GitHub repository which contains a set of good practices and style guides for AngularJS application development.
Its main goal is to be community-driven and to concentrate all the best practices for AngularJS development in one place.
I’ve collected these guidelines mostly from my own experience and the source code of AngularJS. I guess there are missing things thats why I’ll try to fill the gaps in future.</description>

I’ll skip the well known stuff about combining images into sprites, inlining images, DNS pre-fetching, combining and minifying script files, gzipping and so on. There are plenty of articles and tools which will help you about these things. There are also excellent researches on these topics, few of the best I’ve read are these by Mobify, Web Performance Daybook Volume, High Performance Web Sites and Critical rendering path – Crash course on web performance and many others.</description>

      <title>Why I should use publish/subscribe in JavaScript</title>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/2013/04/24/why-to-use-publishsubscribe-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>This post is inspired by my answer at StackOverflow.
So why we should use publish/subscribe? Why it is useful? Is it making our work harder or it makes our application better?
And the answer&amp;hellip;
It’s all about loose coupling and single responsibility, which goes hand to hand with MV* (MVC/MVP/MVVM) patterns in JavaScript which are very modern in the last few years.
Loose coupling is an Object-oriented principle in which each component of the system knows it’s responsibility and don’t care about the other components (or at least tries to not care about them as much as possible).</description>

      <description>This article is about the functional concepts of JavaScript. Some of them are built-in the languages, others extra implemented but all of them are very common for purely functional languages like Haskell. First I want to tell what I mean with the term purely functional language. These languages are “safe”, they will not make side effect i.e. evaluating an expression won’t change something in the internal state and lead to different result of the same expression when called next time.</description>

To prove this I’ll first ask few rhetorical questions and put their answers&amp;hellip;Which is the programming language which everyone has interpreter for? Java? Actually no! Does iOS supports Java applets for example?! No! Everyone has a browser in his smartphone. Every browser (well may be I should exclude lynx, links&amp;hellip;) has JavaScript interpreter. And what is the common thing between all modern devices (and actually the devices most wide spread) – the browser.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I’ve created a GitHub repository. It’s main goal was to collect different algorithms with implementations in JavaScript. I started with basic ones – sorting (insertion, selection, bubble sort..). After that I implemented few “more advance” like marge, quick and heap sort. It was interesting to me how much slower my implementation will be compared to the default sort. It was so interesting because of:
function sort() { [native code] }  That’s why I’ve wrote not optimized version of mergesort and I’ve run it with generated array with 500k elements.</description>

I’ve got very close experience with the first two of the mentioned but the localStorage was somehow unknown for me since a month. I’ve researched the topic. Actually it’s quite interesting and useful as you might guess. Using localStorage you can save different kinds of data locally into key-value pairs. The data lives on your local machine until it’s deleted (cleared).</description>

(function () { // body of the function }());  The anonymous function above will be invoked right after it has been defined. The benefit of self-invoking functions is that they enable us to execute code once without cluttering the global namespace (without declaring any globals).</description>

12.04 on my home machine so I put on it Oracle Java and Android SDK. I also installed few packages from the SDK (platform-tools). I created few udev rules, because my computer wasn’t able to know what to do when I plug-in my Nexus with a fastboot mode.</description>

      <description>Тъй като съм вече студент 3-ти курс във ФМИ и курсовите проекти се натрупаха, мисля че мога да бъда полезен на “младото поколение ФМИ-исти”, като предоставя една страница с връзки към кода, който съм разработил. Това ще можете да намерите в новата секция на блога ми “FMI Projects”.
Надявам се с това да помогна на студентите или да накарам преподавателите да проявят повече въображение в бъдещите задания към студентите :-).</description>

      <description>And one post in English&amp;hellip;For few days I’m developing one jQuery UI plugin. It’s picture gallery which I’ve seen in flash but not in JavaScript, that’s why I decided to fix this. The gallery is a set of rotating pictures and difference ways of handling the perspective. There’s nothing complicated in it just little analytic geometry. I haven’t used any canvases or SVG because I’ve wanted the biggest possible browser compatibility.</description>

      <description>В потребителската група SofiaJS последните няколко месеца се случиха доста интересни неща, а на мен все не ми остава време, за да блогна за тях&amp;hellip; След хубавата лекция на Асен Божилов (за Google Chrome Extensions) и дискусията, която проведохме, Асен се включи активно в организацията и покани най-известния лектор, участвал в срещите – Стоян Стефанов. От своя страна Telerik указаха подкрепа, която оценявам, със своята покана лекцията да се проведе в тяхна зала.</description>

      <title>Color animation plugin for jQuery</title>

      <description>Hi! I haven’t wrote since a long time but there’s so much code and so little time&amp;hellip;It’s bad that the biggest part of the code is not open source but what can we do&amp;hellip;Last few hours I developed a JavaScript plugin for color animation. Of course for few hours I cant make something with great quality so it’s a little bit unstable (I think) but it works and it’s also valid for the JSLint standards.</description>

      <description>Преди няколко месеца внезапно (както май често става) започнах да мисля за програмиране (как ли така&amp;hellip;) и най-вече за JavaScript. Забелязах как все повече програмисти се насочват към този език, как все повече започва да се използва навсякъде (дори за server-side приложения) и все пак колко слабо е развито community-то в България. Бях взимал участие в .net потребителските групи и забелязах колко интересни дискусии се получават. Също така ми направи впечатление колко е приятно да се събират хора с еднакви интереси, на които работата им доставя истинско удоволствие (както е в моя случай).</description>

      <title>Sound notification in web page</title>

      <description>Few days ago I was creating a system in which it was necessary to implement a sound notification feature. Well it’s not very hard task but of course you have to be careful with the browser compatibility. At first my source was something like that:
playSound: function () { this.config.soundNotify.html(&amp;#39;&amp;lt;embed src=&amp;quot;&amp;#39; + this.config.soundFile + &amp;#39;.wav&amp;quot; hidden=true autostart=true loop=false&amp;gt;&amp;#39;); }  Actually in my Linux it was working pretty well (I tried it mainly in Chrome).</description>

      <description>Тази сутрин пуснах прословутата f8&amp;hellip;Бях с големи очаквания (дори поствах за нея), може би заради слабата ми информираност очаквах нещо като Google I/O (има си Google&amp;hellip;защо не потърсих предварително&amp;hellip;). Streaming-a тръгна и очаквано видях Марк Зукърбърг. Вместо той да говори за нови технологии и с какви средства е създал нещо ново, започна да прави реклама на новите feature-и на Facebook&amp;hellip;Дам трябваше да прочета повече преди да си настроя часовника да звъни толкова рано&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Като всеки любознателен developer и аз се включих към хората, които искат да получат mail от Google при пускането на API за Google+. Вчера (15-ти септември) около 1 часа получих следния mail:
 Getting Started on the Google+ API
Greetings developers,
Thank you for showing your interest in the Google+ platform on our developer interest form. We promised to let you know when we had more details to share. Well, that time has come&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Ajax without jQuery for beginners</title>
      <link>http://blog.mgechev.com/2011/07/21/ajax-jquery-beginners/</link>

      <description>Before years I was writing all the code by my own, without additional libraries (including jQuery). For beginner developer it’s a good strategy. When you use $.ajax it’s all that easy:
$.ajax({ url: &amp;quot;any/url/for/the/request&amp;quot;, type: &amp;quot;get&amp;quot;, success: function(data){ alert(data); } });  But you can’t get the main idea.
Many developers don’t have an idea how to write this without a library. In their opinion AJAX without library a hard, near impossible task.</description>

      <description>That’s my second post here and the first one which is going to have any sense. Today a friend of mine was fighting with Google’s blog system&amp;hellip;He was posting some data with images in it. When he was setting width and height of images in the html editor they were being resized later after he post the article. When he tried to put any CSS restriction about picture’s width the effect was – picture flattened (because blogger was setting the picture height).</description>
