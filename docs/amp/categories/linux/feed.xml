      <description>Before few months I was invited by Telerik Academy to make a talk about JavaScript. Last Monday Marian Kostadinov, Radoslav Georgiev and me made a whole seminar about the topic. I’m addicted to the Object-Oriented programming so I choose to talk about that. You can find my slides at https://blog.mgechev.com/slides/javascript-patterns and a video (in Bulgarian) below in the post:
It was quite exciting for me to speak about this topic in front of about 200 people.</description>

      <description>plainvm can take the virtualization into different level of usage. To prove this I’ll first ask few rhetorical questions and put their answers&amp;hellip;Which is the programming language which everyone has interpreter for? Java? Actually no! Does iOS supports Java applets for example?! No! Everyone has a browser in his smartphone. Every browser (well may be I should exclude lynx, links&amp;hellip;) has JavaScript interpreter. And what is the common thing between all modern devices (and actually the devices most wide spread) – the browser.</description>

      <title>Looking for performance? Probably you should NOT use [].sort (V8)</title>

      <description>A few days ago, I’ve created a GitHub repository. It’s main goal was to collect different algorithms with implementations in JavaScript. I started with basic ones – sorting (insertion, selection, bubble sort..). After that I implemented few “more advance” like marge, quick and heap sort. It was interesting to me how much slower my implementation will be compared to the default sort. It was so interesting because of:
function sort() { [native code] }  That’s why I’ve wrote not optimized version of mergesort and I’ve run it with generated array with 500k elements.</description>

      <title>Asus N56VZ &#43; Ubuntu 12.04 (en)</title>

      <description>It seems that it’s common a problem to setup Ubuntu on the new Asus N56VZ so I decided to create an English version of my post.
I was struggling with three issues about two weeks. Here are they:
 Multimedia buttons (Fn+F*) Subwoofer Ethernet adapter  I’ll start with the Subwoofer issue because it’s with the easiest fix. Adding options snd-hda-intel model=asus-mode4 at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf  will solve the problem.</description>

      <description>Един пост на български, защото мисля, че ще бъде по-полезен.
Доста време се тормозя с подкарването на разни feature-и на новия ми Asus N56 с Ubuntu 12.04 x86-64&amp;hellip;Мултимедия бутоните (комбинация между Fn+F*), съббуфера, като имах известни проблеми (не особени, но все пак трябва да се отбележат) и с ethernet.
И така, нека започна от съббуфера, защото решението е най-лесно. Добавянето на options snd-hda-intel model=asus-mode4 в края на /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, решава проблема.</description>

      <description>I’m here again, after a long pause. For a while I’ve got problems with my health and I’m nailed at home&amp;hellip;so I’ve go a lot of free time. Last night I’ve decided to root my Google Nexus S.
I use Ubuntu

12.04 on my home machine so I put on it Oracle Java and Android SDK. I also installed few packages from the SDK (platform-tools). I created few udev rules, because my computer wasn’t able to know what to do when I plug-in my Nexus with a fastboot mode.</description>
