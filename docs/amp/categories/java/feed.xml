      <description>This article is about the functional concepts of JavaScript. Some of them are built-in the languages, others extra implemented but all of them are very common for purely functional languages like Haskell. First I want to tell what I mean with the term purely functional language. These languages are “safe”, they will not make side effect i.e. evaluating an expression won’t change something in the internal state and lead to different result of the same expression when called next time.</description>

      <description>plainvm can take the virtualization into different level of usage. To prove this I’ll first ask few rhetorical questions and put their answers&amp;hellip;Which is the programming language which everyone has interpreter for? Java? Actually no! Does iOS supports Java applets for example?! No! Everyone has a browser in his smartphone. Every browser (well may be I should exclude lynx, links&amp;hellip;) has JavaScript interpreter. And what is the common thing between all modern devices (and actually the devices most wide spread) – the browser.</description>

      <description>And one more blog post by me! It’s going to be in brand new topic than the others. For about an year and a half I’ve got an idea which I wanted to accomplish&amp;hellip;To create my own simple programming language. Actually it’s very useful task and quite interesting. Creating it you can get better understanding how the compilers and interpreters work and probably write better code. Unfortunately there were two problems&amp;hellip;I didn’t have enough time for such task and&amp;hellip;I’ve not studied formal grammars (and as I mentioned I don’t have enough time to study them&amp;hellip;there are just so much more interesting things to read about :-P ).</description>
