      <description>In this series of blog posts I’m going to cover the paper I’m writing at GitHub.
It aims to provide a bit more theoretical overview of some of the AngularJS components in order to show you how the things you are already familiar with (like different Object-Oriented Design Patterns) fit in the picture.
Part one includes only a high level overview of AngularJS, enjoy it.
AngularJS overview AngularJS is JavaScript framework developed by Google.</description>

      <title>Singleton in JavaScript</title>

      <description>Wikipedia describes the singleton design pattern as:
 The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.</description>

      <title>What I get from the JavaScript MV* frameworks</title>

      <description>Why should I use JavaScript MVC, MVVM, MVP or simply MVW(hatever works for you)?
When I talk with people, who are beginners/intermediate in JavaScript I’m often asked this question. They are usually people who, until now, have used JavaScript only for making their website “fancier” – adding client-side form validation, creating carousel, checking whether a user already exists with simple Ajax request. When you start building something bigger (+10k lines of JavaScript) I truly believe that there are a few benefits from using such micro-architectural frameworks.</description>

      <title>The magic of $resource (or simply a client-side Active Record)</title>

      <description>At first sight AngularJS seems like a magical framework, which does some weird but awesome things like dependency injection, data binding only by setting a single property to the magical object named $scope and many other things.
If you look at the source code of Angular you’ll see a lot of smart and simple solutions for these magical problems. In this blog post I’ll describe the magic which stays behind $resource.</description>

      <title>AngularJS Inheritance Patterns</title>

      <description>Since AngularJS does not provide any built-in features for using inheritance, in this blog post I’ll describe how the general JavaScript inheritance patterns can be applied to AngularJS components.
Controllers inheritance First, lets talk about controllers. Actually it is very unlikely to inherit from parent controller (except when you&amp;rsquo;re using the controller as syntax, see below). This is the case because by implementation the scope in the child controller will inherit prototypically from its parent scope.</description>

      <title>Aspect-Oriented Programming with AngularJS</title>

      <description>In the following blog post I’ll write few words about what is Aspect-Oriented Programming, why I think it will be useful in AngularJS and I’m also going to give you a short tutorial for using a simple AOP framework I’ve developed.
First things first. What is AOP? As we all know OOP is awesome! It gives us many tools for making our development process simpler. Its core principles are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.</description>

      <description>Before few months I was invited by Telerik Academy to make a talk about JavaScript. Last Monday Marian Kostadinov, Radoslav Georgiev and me made a whole seminar about the topic. I’m addicted to the Object-Oriented programming so I choose to talk about that. You can find my slides at http://blog.mgechev.com/slides/javascript-patterns and a video (in Bulgarian) below in the post:
It was quite exciting for me to speak about this topic in front of about 200 people.</description>

      <title>Why I should use publish/subscribe in JavaScript</title>
      <link>http://blog.mgechev.com/amp/2013/04/24/why-to-use-publishsubscribe-in-javascript/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.mgechev.com/amp/2013/04/24/why-to-use-publishsubscribe-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>This post is inspired by my answer at StackOverflow.
So why we should use publish/subscribe? Why it is useful? Is it making our work harder or it makes our application better?
And the answer&amp;hellip;
It’s all about loose coupling and single responsibility, which goes hand to hand with MV* (MVC/MVP/MVVM) patterns in JavaScript which are very modern in the last few years.
Loose coupling is an Object-oriented principle in which each component of the system knows it’s responsibility and don’t care about the other components (or at least tries to not care about them as much as possible).</description>
