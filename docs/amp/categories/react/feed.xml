      <description>About two months ago I published my initial research[1] on data-driven bundling. A few weeks after that, I had the opportunity to present my work on RenderConf in Oxford, UK in my talk &amp;ldquo;Teach Your Bundler Users&amp;rsquo; Habits&amp;rdquo;[2].&#xA;The original goal of the article was to show how data can help in improving the user-perceived page load performance by using predictive analytics[3]. The artifacts from the article were executable node modules which can be used for predictive pre-fetching &amp;amp; data-driven clustering of JavaScript chunks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Bundling. The Future of JavaScript Tooling.</title>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the early implementation of a few tools which based on techniques from the machine learning allow us to perform data-driven chunk clustering and pre-fetching for single-page applications. The purpose is to provide a zero-configuration mechanism which based on data from Google Analytics for the users&amp;rsquo; behavior performs the most optimal build. We&amp;rsquo;re also going to introduce a webpack plugin which works with Angular CLI and Create React App.</description>

      <description>For the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project which uses React with TypeScript and Redux. In a few blog posts I&amp;rsquo;m planning to share lessons learned while combining these technologies. In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll share a few anti-patterns related to state management that I noticed in our development process. In the second article I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on testability.&#xA;All of the anti-patterns below have the following structure:&#xA;Introduction Problem definition Sample solutions with discussion of their pros and cons State Duplication Sometimes we have instances of the same business entity used in different contexts.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging mostly about Angular and it&amp;rsquo;s not by accident! Angular is an amazing framework, bringing a lot of innovation to the front-end technologies, with a great community behind it. In the same time, the projects that I&amp;rsquo;m working on have various of different requirements and sometimes I need to consider different options.&#xA;Another great technology that I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past is React. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to compare it with Angular; I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are variety of cases when one of them fits better compared to the other and visa versa.</description>

      <title>Flux in Depth. Store and Network Communication.</title>

      <description>This is the second, and probably be the last, blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. In the first post we did a quick overview of flux, took a look at the stateless, pure components, immutable data structures and component communication. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to introduce the store and how we can communicate with services through the network via HTTP, WebSocket or WebRTC. Since the flux architecture doesn&amp;rsquo;t define a way of communication with external services, here you can find my way of dealing with network communication.</description>

      <title>Using JSX with TypeScript</title>

      <description>JavaScript is a weird language although, we love it the way it is. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a painful experience working on big JavaScript projects. It was painful in the same way it gets painful working on huge Ruby, Python, PHP projects.&#xA;Once you have code base above 10-15k lines of code and you decide to do some refactoring&amp;hellip;well it gets messy. Although grep and sed are powerful tools for text manipulation, when you start replacing code with them, you&amp;rsquo;re missing the semantics (or the context) of the snippets you substitute.</description>

      <title>Flux in Depth. Overview and Components.</title>

      <description>This is the first blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. Is this &amp;ldquo;yet the another flux tutorial&amp;rdquo;? What I have seen so far, while researching flux, were mostly &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; tutorials (usually with todo applications), which describe the main components of given flux application and the data flow between them. This is definitely useful for getting a high-level overview of how everything works but in reality there are plenty of other things, which should be taken under consideration.</description>

      <title>WebRTC chat with React.js</title>

      <description>In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m going to share how could be build WebRTC chat with React.js. Before we continue lets describe briefly what React.js and WebRTC are.&#xA;The application from this tutorial is available at GitHub.&#xA;React.js React.js is reactive JavaScript framework, which helps you to build user interface. Facebook states that we can think of React as the &amp;ldquo;V&amp;rdquo; in MVC. React&amp;rsquo;s main aspect is the state. When the state of the application changes this automatically propagates through the application&amp;rsquo;s components.</description>
