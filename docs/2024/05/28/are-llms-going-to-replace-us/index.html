                    <p>Over the past few years, I have published most of my posts on <a href="https://blog.angular.dev">blog.angular.dev</a> and my blog has received little attention. Today, I decided to share something that has been on the mind lately. It&rsquo;s inspired by a mixture of one of the most memorable moments from my university classes and the recent boom of AI. Through the lens of the theory of computation I&rsquo;ll attempt to answer the question, &ldquo;Are we going to be replaced by AI?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I were a YouTuber, I&rsquo;d have said, &ldquo;Make sure you read the article until the end to find the answer&hellip;Also, make sure you like and subscribe.&rdquo; Luckily, I&rsquo;m not a YouTuber, and I don&rsquo;t want to lose your time, so if you&rsquo;re looking for an answer, you better stop reading here. If you&rsquo;d enjoy my brief rambling incorporating some of my limited understanding of mathematics and philosophy, please spend the next 3 minutes reading through.</p>
<p>A popular theorem shows that computers cannot solve all the problems. I&rsquo;d not dig into a formal proof, but it pretty much goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The set of all the programs is at most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set">countable</a></strong>. Since every computer program is represented by a finite list of characters, we can create a bidirectional mapping between each computer program and the set of natural numbers. We call sets with bidirectional mapping to the natural numbers countable.</li>
<li><strong>The set of all the problems is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set">uncountable</a></strong>. We can think of the problems as functions over real numbers because each real number would theoretically correspond to a solution. There are more real numbers than integers based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor&rsquo;s diagonal argument</a>. The set of all the problems is an example of an uncountable set.</li>
<li><strong>Therefore, there are more problems than programs&hellip;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All machine learning models operate on a classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a> based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>. Even with a Turing machine with an infinite tape, we&rsquo;ll be able to develop, at most, a countable number of programs; thus, even with a theoretical supercomputer based on this model, we&rsquo;d not be able to solve all the problems. In practice, things are even more challenging since modern computers have finite memory.</p>
<p>You probably already see the connection with the question, &ldquo;Are humans replaceable by AI?&rdquo; What I love about math is that it&rsquo;s very versatile, so we can create abstract models that are still helpful for specific use cases. To compare humans to AI, we can define a human as a function that receives an input and produces an output. My current hypothesis is that whether AI could replace humans depends on this function&rsquo;s type signature. Does it operate over an uncountable or a countable set? Does it produce results from an uncountable or a countable set?</p>
<p>Just for simplicity, let&rsquo;s refer to countable sets as N and uncountable as R. We can define four functions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">f(x) -&gt; y, where x, y ∈ N, for short f(N) -&gt; N
f(x) -&gt; y, where x, y ∈ R, for short f(R) -&gt; R
f(x) -&gt; y, where x ∈ N, y ∈ R, for short f(N) -&gt; R
f(x) -&gt; y, where x ∈ R, y ∈ N, for short f(R) -&gt; N
</code></pre></div><p>AI is <code>f(N) -&gt; N</code>, and it could replace us if we&rsquo;re also <code>f(N) -&gt; N</code>.</p>
<p>To a large extent, our society operates under the assumption that we are indeed <code>f(N) -&gt; N</code>. We believe we have a countable number of senses, we&rsquo;re very much oriented to knowing a countable number of facts, and we read instructional books that help us act in a countable number of ways in a countable number of situations.</p>
<p>I wrote a book about Angular a few years ago, so I produced a countable number of characters. We can define a function that writes the optimal book based on humans' collective understanding of an optimal book at a given time. If we are countable, our collective understanding would also be countable. The book&rsquo;s content is countable by definition, meaning AI could replace book authors.
Does that mean that we have just a few generations of book authors left, and after that, everything will be produced by AI? It depends if humans are <code>f(R) -&gt; N</code> or <code>f(R) -&gt; R</code>. The first means that AI will have to simplify the input in order to process it, and the second means that we&rsquo;re limiting ourselves by expressing ideas in writing. Limiting ourselves in writing is probably the beauty of it because our imagination can fill the gaps.</p>
<p>Many individuals believe humans are <code>f(R) -&gt; R</code>. It is the foundation of many spiritual beliefs and religions. If we are <code>f(R) -&gt; R</code> indeed, then the output produced by AI would sometimes feel dissatisfying because it&rsquo;ll be imprecise compared to the expectations of a human. Does this make AI impractical or a lost cause? I think that it does not. An output from a countable set is still large enough to provide an accurate estimation that is helpful to humans.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it&rsquo;s hard to say if AI will replace humans or which humans, but I can take a shot at guessing what kind of function would best model us. Imagine having AI as a friend or partner. It would likely be reliable and more deterministic than humans, but likely dissatisfying. Over time, AI and robotics researchers may increase the spectrum of the AI&rsquo;s inputs and outputs to make it an even closer approximation of a human. Still, my intuition says that&rsquo;s already a sign that we might be working over uncountable sets.</p>
