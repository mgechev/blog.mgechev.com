      <description>In this series of blog posts I’m going to cover the paper I’m writing at GitHub.
It aims to provide a bit more theoretical overview of some of the AngularJS components in order to show you how the things you are already familiar with (like different Object-Oriented Design Patterns) fit in the picture.
Part one includes only a high level overview of AngularJS, enjoy it.
AngularJS overview AngularJS is JavaScript framework developed by Google.</description>

      <title>What I get from the JavaScript MV* frameworks</title>

      <description>Why should I use JavaScript MVC, MVVM, MVP or simply MVW(hatever works for you)?
When I talk with people, who are beginners/intermediate in JavaScript I’m often asked this question. They are usually people who, until now, have used JavaScript only for making their website “fancier” – adding client-side form validation, creating carousel, checking whether a user already exists with simple Ajax request. When you start building something bigger (+10k lines of JavaScript) I truly believe that there are a few benefits from using such micro-architectural frameworks.</description>

      <description>Before few months I was invited by Telerik Academy to make a talk about JavaScript. Last Monday Marian Kostadinov, Radoslav Georgiev and me made a whole seminar about the topic. I’m addicted to the Object-Oriented programming so I choose to talk about that. You can find my slides at https://blog.mgechev.com/slides/javascript-patterns and a video (in Bulgarian) below in the post:
It was quite exciting for me to speak about this topic in front of about 200 people.</description>
