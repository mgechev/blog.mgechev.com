      <description>In order to have better understanding of the following blog post you should be familiar with the fundamentals of the object-oriented and functional programming. I also strongly encourage you to explore the redux pattern.
A couple of months ago I started working on the first version of a Silicon Valley-based startup. The project is a single-page application with quite dynamic business requirements. As in most modern single-page applications we have a fat client which encapsulates decent amount of business logic and state.</description>

      <description>This is the second, and probably be the last, blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. In the first post we did a quick overview of flux, took a look at the stateless, pure components, immutable data structures and component communication. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to introduce the store and how we can communicate with services through the network via HTTP, WebSocket or WebRTC. Since the flux architecture doesn&amp;rsquo;t define a way of communication with external services, here you can find my way of dealing with network communication.</description>

      <description>This is the first blog post of the series &amp;ldquo;Flux in Depth&amp;rdquo;. Is this &amp;ldquo;yet the another flux tutorial&amp;rdquo;? What I have seen so far, while researching flux, were mostly &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; tutorials (usually with todo applications), which describe the main components of given flux application and the data flow between them. This is definitely useful for getting a high-level overview of how everything works but in reality there are plenty of other things, which should be taken under consideration.</description>
