      <description>ES6 generators have landed in Chrome 39 Beta on 9th of October and are already available in the stable version. This means that brand new development practices are already applicable, although for supporting older browsers you might need to fallback to the traceroute compiler.
A cool module, which TJ developed, called co, is available for quite a while (his initial commit in the co repository was on 6th of June 2013).</description>

      <description>ES6 specification is being clarified every passed day! One of the key features of the new version of the language are the generators. Generators (a.k.a. semicoroutines) will play quite important role after they are being officially released. They could be used to simplify the asynchronous control flow of any JavaScript program (look at co). Another important role is using them for creating iterators.
In this blog post we are going to take a look at how could be implemented iterator of binary search tree using the ES6 generators.</description>
