      <description>In this blog post I’ll tell few words about the course Advanced JavaScript which Georgi Penkov, Evgeni Kunev and me are leading this semester in Sofia University.
I was included as a lecturer in it after my project for Practical Programming with Perl (plainvm) which is created by Georgi Penkov. The idea behind the course is not to concentrate on the syntax of JavaScript but to introduce to the students different modern technologies.</description>

      <description>As you see HTML5 is everywhere (of course I exclude IE&amp;hellip;or just before version 10). Web site used for quick image composition or edition is something very useful for the “modern web person”. There are few such services. Most of them use Flash. Nothing against it but&amp;hellip;it’s too heavy for me&amp;hellip;unnecessarily heavy. For all that stuff you can use HTML5 canvas. I also found some HTML5 image editors but their functionality was very limited.</description>

      <title>Ajax without jQuery for beginners</title>

      <description>Before years I was writing all the code by my own, without additional libraries (including jQuery). For beginner developer it’s a good strategy. When you use $.ajax it’s all that easy:
$.ajax({ url: &amp;#34;any/url/for/the/request&amp;#34;, type: &amp;#34;get&amp;#34;, success: function(data){ alert(data); } });  But you can’t get the main idea.
Many developers don’t have an idea how to write this without a library. In their opinion AJAX without library a hard, near impossible task.</description>
