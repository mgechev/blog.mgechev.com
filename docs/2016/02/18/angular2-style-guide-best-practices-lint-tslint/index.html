                    <p>About two weeks ago I published the initial draft of a <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide">Community-driven Angular 2 Style Guide</a>. It was based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns I noticed in the Angular 2 source code while contributing to the framework.</li>
<li>Suggestions by Miško Hevery during his technical review of my book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/switching-angular-2">Switching to Angular 2</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>My own development experience with Angular 2.</li>
<li>AngularJS 1.x common practices which could be applied to Angular 2 applications keeping the transition process smoother.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/ngsg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the time of the first push of the document I got a quick feedback by the manager of Angular Brad Green:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mgechev">@mgechev</a> Love the start and the great explanations. And a smashing logo to boot! :) <a href="https://t.co/7dPVQPvhQa">pic.twitter.com/7dPVQPvhQa</a></p>&mdash; Brad Green (@bradlygreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/bradlygreen/status/694954284161462272">February 3, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>As you might guess the initial draft was a bit misshaped and based only on my personal perspective. Although the great ideas I got from Miško Hevery, everything went through my own prism. That was the main idea to publish it on this early stage of the Angular&rsquo;s life-cycle - to gather feedback from other great, experienced developers.</p>
<p>We had great discussions on the <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide/issues/5">directory structure</a> that we all agreed upon. We achieved balance between suggestions by <a href="https://github.com/e-oz">@e-oz</a> for by-type division, <a href="https://github.com/evanplaice">@evanplaice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nareshbhatia">@nareshbhatia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/d3viant0ne">@d3viant0ne</a> and all other great ideas proposed during the discussion. Of course, that is only a small fraction of all the brainstorming. You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide/issues">issues of the project for more</a>.</p>
<p>What are the biggest benefits I found working in such an open environment?</p>
<h3 id="diverse-experience">Diverse Experience</h3>
<p>The best practices went through the perspective of different developers with diverse experience. Showing everyone&rsquo;s point of views and agreeing upon common, generic practices that can work for most of us is priceless.</p>
<p>Another great benefit is that one extra pair of eyes can find and help fixing <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide/issues/13">mistakes</a> and deliver everything into a <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide/issues/16">more consistent way</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rediscovering-best-practices">Rediscovering Best Practices</h3>
<p>We rediscovered already existing best practices and patterns from the software engineering such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html">Bounded context</a> a concept from the Domain-Driven Development that helps us divide our code units in the most balanced way.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">Façade pattern</a> a design pattern, initially introduced by the Gang of Four which fits perfectly in providing a high-level interface for a larger body of code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Facing same problems solved decades ago and using the same terms helps us communicate easier. In the end, that is one of the core purposes of the design patterns - to ease the communication across developers.</p>
<h3 id="learning-new-things">Learning new Things</h3>
<p>Definitely, it is worth mentioning that everyone expressing his thoughts and opinion on given topic can extend our knowledge.</p>
<p>I believe these are only a few of the benefits from the open source ideology.</p>
<h2 id="going-a-bit-further">Going a bit further!</h2>
<p>Building a complete set of best practices which puts most of the Angular 2 projects under a common shape is quite important. There is no point explaining why it is worth following a common guidelines that are pointing the correct path.</p>
<p>But what is the process we use to enforce these practices? Code review. This means that one human being writes code, trying to follow all the practices listed in a huge document and another human being needs to verify that these practices are followed properly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one sure thing - this is quite an error-prone mission!</p>
<p>During the last a couple of days I&rsquo;m working on a static code analyzer which makes sure we&rsquo;re following the best practices. Since its main goal is to be configurable, I&rsquo;m planning to make it compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-style-guide">community-driven style guide</a> we are working on, as well as the John Papa&rsquo;s style guide which should be released in the next a couple of months.</p>
<p>I called the project <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/ng2lint">ng2lint</a> and at this moment it is based on tslint.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-ng2lint-work">How does ng2lint work?</h3>
<p>What ng2lint does is to take the abstract-syntax tree (AST) generated by the TypeScript compiler based on the source code of our application and analyze it. If you have further interest on the topic I strongly recommend you to take a look at &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Design-Dick-Grune/dp/1461446988">Modern Compiler Design 2nd ed.</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans">Future plans&hellip;</h3>
<p>TypeScript builds a great intermediate representation of the code we write, which is perfect for analysis. However, such an intermediate representation for an Angular 2 project could be considered as a superset of what TypeScript provides us. For instance, in Angular 2 each component has a template. In order to verify that all used inside this template directives are declared in the <code>directives</code> property of the target component or any other parent component, we need to parse the template as well.</p>
<p>And what about file naming conventions? Well, we&rsquo;ll need to verify all the naming is following common conventions as well!</p>
<p>Given all this a more sophisticated tool will be required. Since I&rsquo;m working on this linter in my spare time I cannot guarantee full style guide coverage in the next a couple of months but you can <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/ng2lint#roadmap">follow my progress here</a>.</p>
